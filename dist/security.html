            <h1>HTTP headers</h1>
            <p>The headers contain information about the conversation being had between the client and server.HTTP headers
                 can set powerful rules about security.
            </p>
            <p>Headers can be grouped according to their contexts</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Request headers : It contain more information about the resource to be fetched,
                    or about the client requesting the resource</li>
                <li>Response headers : It holds additional information about the response,
                     like its location or about the server providing it.</li>
                <li>Representation headers : contain information about the body of the resource</li>
                <li>Payload headers : contain representation-independent information about payload data,
                     including content length and the encoding used for transport.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Request Headers</p>
            <ul>
                <li>From: In Internet mail format, this gives the name of the requesting user. This field may be used for
                     logging purposes and an insecure form of access protection</li>
                <li>Accept: This field contains a semicolon-separated list of representation schemes</li>
                <li>Accept-Encoding: Similar to Accept, but lists the Content-Encoding types which are acceptable in the response.</li>
                <li>Accept-Language: Similar to Accept, but lists the Language values which are preferable in the response. 
                    A response in an unspecifies language is not illegal. </li>
                <li>User-Agent: This line if present gives the software program used by the original client. This is for statistical purposes and
                     the tracing of protocol violations. It should be included. The first white space delimited word must be the software product name, 
                    with an optional slash and version designator. Other products which form part of the user agent may be put as separate words.</li>
                <li>Referer:This optional header field allows the client to specify, for the server's benefit, the address ( URI ) of the document </li>    
                <li>Authorization: If this line is present it contains authorization information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Response Headers</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Age: The Age header contains the time in seconds the object has been in a proxy cache.Example : Age: 24 ,A non-negative integer, representing time in 
                    seconds the object has been in a proxy cache.</li>
                <li>Location : The Location response header indicates the URL to redirect a page to. It only provides a
                     meaning when served with a 3xx (redirection) or 201 (created) status response. For Example : Location: url . A relative or absolute URL.</li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>Representation Headers</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Content-Type: The Content-Type representation header is used to indicate the original media type of the resource</li>
                <li>Content-Encoding : The Content-Encoding representation header lists any encodings that have been applied
                     to the representation (message payload), and in what order.Content encoding is mainly used to compress the message
                    data without losing information about the origin media type.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Payload Headers</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Payload header: A payload header is an HTTP header that describes the payload information related to safe transport and reconstruction of the original resource representation, 
                    from one or more messages.This includes information like the length of the message payload,</li>
                <li>Content-Length : The Content-Length header indicates the size of the message body, in bytes, sent to the recipient.</li>
                <li>Content-Range : The Content-Range response HTTP header indicates where in a full body message a partial message belongs.
                    For example Content-Range: bytes 200-1000/67589 </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Encryption of data in transit</h1>
            <p> It means transmit data via the hypertext transfer protocol.
                If a URL begins with 'https' though, it means that the HTTP protocol is actually within another protocol - TLS.
                TLS encrypts connections (and the data within them), so you can have your HTTP requests and responses happening without 
                the risk of someone reading (or changing) them along the way.When we are getting an SSL certificate for our website,
                which means we actually getting a TLS certificate!</p>
            <p>To transmit data with an encrepted format first an SSL certificate is required. and secondly set
                 Strict-Transport-Security HTTP header to make https mandatory.

            <h1>Security features that are a result of not doing things</h1>
            <p>When visiting a website that asks for sensitive information such as credit card numbers or social security number, 
                the first step is to take to securing privacy is creating a strong password.Make sure that the website is encrypted over a secure connection.</p>
            <p>Most browsers have sophisticated filters that can identify and warn of potential security threats.</p>

            <h1>Security Principles</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Authentication : The authentication process verifies that you are who you claim to be.
                    Identity is verified based on the credentials that we present, such as username/password,digital certificate.</li>
                <li>Granting access to specific resources based on an authenticated user.</li>
                <li>Auditing : A record that confidently shows that what has been happening.</li>
