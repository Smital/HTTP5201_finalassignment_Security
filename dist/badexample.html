           <h1>Sensitive data exposure</h1>
           <p>Sensitive data such as credit card information and user passwords should never travel or be stored unencrypted, 
               and passwords should always be hashed.Sensitive data exposure occurs as a result of not protecting a 
               database where information is stored. </p>
          <p>Sensitive data can be found stored in plain text documents.If websites do not use SSL and do not have HTTPS security on web pages 
              that store information, data may be at risk of being exposed.</p>
          <p>For example the website https://app.photobucket.com is not as much secure because if we login to the website using username and password
             by not using the POST method to transfer data and not using the proper encryption method,the password is sotred as a plain text,
             and any malicious user can see the password in the URL like https://app.photobucket.com/u/Smital123456?register=true.Morover,the password can also 
             seen in the memory tab of the dev tools which is not acceptable.
          </p>
          <p>The http headers are not properly defined as some of them are missing which is not good practice to make a securing website.Header such as Strict-Transport-Security is not set which ensures that visiting web browser that the current site
               is not HTTPS-only.</p>
