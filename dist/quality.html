            <h1>Version Control</h1>
            <p>Version control is known as source control and it is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
                Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.If a mistake is made, 
                developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while
                minimizing disruption to all team members.One developer from the team may be working on a new feature while another 
                developer fixes bugs by changing code, each developer may make their changes in several parts of the file tree.Version control 
                helps teams solve these kinds of problems,tracking every individual change and reduces the conflicts.
            </p>
            <p>There are different types of version control software is available such as
                <ul>
                    <li>Bitbucket</li>
                    <li>Git</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Here I am using the Git version control system for this assignment.First to work with git,repository plays an important role.
              Git repository is is a software project that uses git to keep track of its changes.There are two repos which are local and remote.
              The copy of a project is stored on local machine called local repos and the copy of a project stored on server is called remote repo.
              Below are the commands which are used to create and stored the project files.
              <ul>
                  <li><b>git init</b> : To intialise the repository.</li>
                  <li><b>git add .</b>: This command will add the files</li>
                  <li><b>git commit -m "message"</b>: This command will commit the all the files with message</li>
                  <li><b>git remote add origin 'your_url_name'</b>: URL will consist of a path of a git. </li>
                  <li><b>git push -u origin maste</b> : Used for pushing local content to GitHub.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Git Branching Model</h1>
            <p>Git allows us to split off temporarily from the existing repo, do our work, and push it to the remote repository
                 without it affecting other developers.Then merge your work back into the main branch./p>
            <p>Below are the commance to creazte a branch repo and push it to the main branch.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><b>git branch [some-name-for-your-branch]</b> : To create a feature branch</li>
                  <li><b>git branch -list</b>: It shows all the branches.</li>
                  <li><b>git checkout [some-name-for-your-branch]</b>: THis command allows us to move to the new created feature branch</li>
                  <li><b>git push -u origin [some-name-for-your-branch]</b>: It will push our code to the remote main branch</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Code linting</h1>
            <p>A linter is a tool that programmatically scans your code with the goal of finding issues that can lead to bugs.It
            will flagging bugs in your code from syntax errors , giving warnings and providing suggestions for common best practices.
            </p>
            <p>Example :</p>
            <p>const test = 'I am a test';
               console.log('text');
               const test = 'Another one';
            </p>
            <p>We are declaring the constant test twice,which our javascript engine will not accept. Instead of getting 
                caught later as an error when the code runs, it will immediately get an error through the linter running in the
                background</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Code standards</h1>
            <p>Coding standards are made up of anything that the team wants.</p>
            <p>Coding Principles</p>
            <p>One variable per declaration, for example, Every local variable declaration declares only one variable: 
                declarations such as let a = 1, b = 2; are not used.</p>
            <p>Dont use the duplicate names and use the camel casing for ids.In camel casing, the first word is all lower case, and subsequent
                 words begin with an upper case letter, with no space between the words.</p>
            <p><b><span id="myFirstPage"></span></b></p>
            <p>Naming convention rules are
                No upper case
                No spaces
                No non-alphanumeric characters other than periods, underscores (_) or hyphens (-)</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>End-to-End Testing</h1>
            <p>It is a software testing method that validates entire software from starting to the end along with its integration with 
                external interfaces</p>
            <p>End to End Testing Design framework consists of three parts</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Build user functions : List the input data, action and the output data for each feature 
                    identify the relationships between the functions</li>
                <li>Build Conditions : Building a set of conditions for each user function defined</li>
                <li>Build Test Cases : Build one or more test cases for each scenario </li>
            </ul>
              <p>For Example : When login into bank account and transfer some money to another account from some other bank.
                <ul>
                    <li>Login into the banking system</li>
                    <li>Check for the balance in the account</li>
                    <li>Transfer some  amount from one account to some other bank account</li>
                    <li>Check latest account balance</li>
                    <li>Logout of the application</li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Ad hoc Testing Tools</h1>
                <p>Adhoc testing is usually performed to break the system an it does not have any test design technique and documentation to create test cases.Modern 
                    dev tools is used for ad hoc testing.</p>
                <p>The Lighthouse and axe auditing tools are important for quickly identifying opportunities to improve load times, SEO and accessibility.</p>
                <p>Device emulation and responsive testing make checking CSS breakpoints.</p>
                <p>Link checking : Checking that there are no broken links on the page.Link Checker is a great Chrome plugin for verifying that the 
                   links on the page are not broken</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Build Tools and Deployment pipeline.</h1>
                <p>Build tools are supposed to save development time and make life easier and similarly try to automate actions that a developer would otherwise
                     have to do manually.Here is a short list of automations that build tools can solve:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Minification: Removing unnecessary whitespace in HTML, CSS and JS, and potentially renaming JS variables and functions with shorter names.</li>
                    <li>Image optimization: Squashing jpegs, pngs, gifs and svgs</li>
                    <li>Rewriting file paths:Changing localhost:8000/assets/images/hero-image.jpg to mydomain.com/images/hero-image.jpg</li>
                    <li>Compiling code :SASS will you to make CSS easier</li>
                    <li>Bundling : It packs together all your modules, including the production dependencies from node_modules, 
                        and delivers them to the user in a single file without you having to worry about browser support.</li>    
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Unit Testing</h1>
                <p>UNIT TESTING is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. Unit testing is a 
                    WhiteBox testing technique that is usually performed by the developer.</p>
                <p>In order to do Unit Testing, we need to write a section of code to test a specific function in software application.
                    Unit testing is commonly automated but may still be performed manually. 
                </p>
